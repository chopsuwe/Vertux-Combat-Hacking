Hacking the Vertux Combat Quickstrike gaming keypad.

The Vertux Combat QuickStrike is a one handed gaming keypad with a thumb joystick similar to the classic Razer Tartarus. The body has the the same layout as a standard keyboard with the addition of a joystick under the thumb.

It is a very well built product with one major problem - the joystick is mapped to the WSAD keys, the same keys that are replicated on the keyboard section. There is no way to change any of the key assignments, which makes the product largely pointless. 

There is very little information about this product on the internet, and, as I was given one to try, out I figured I would try to hack it. Spoiler alert: there is no happy ending, reprogramming it will require someone with better hacking skills than me.

## Who made it?

The Vertux Combat is also sold under the brands of NEXiLUX and IINE. According to [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/o4k474/i_tried_one_of_those_20_aliexpress_pro/h2iuhsj/), IINE sells third party game controllers into Southeast Asia, with a few products appearing on Amazon, eBay and Walmart under the NEXiLUX brand. However it appears this one actually made by NEXiLUX.

## Software and updates

There is no software or drivers available under any of the brand names. Several web sites say "no driver required" and that it is designed for Xbox One, 360, PS 4, 3, Switch, lite, PC. It is possible the macro keys could be mapped as a game controller in Windows but I have not tired this and there is no way to remap the joystick.

The NEXiLUX website does have the gamepad listed under the name PRO GAMING KEYBOARD AND RGB MOUSE COMBO NS/X1/PS4/PC with a [link to a firmware update](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/2caddf61-9f88-40c8-825e-452ee5a1972b/downloads/NEXILUX%20KEYBOARD%20MOUSE%20COMBO%20FIRMWARE%20UPDATE%202.zip?ver=1704647026111) on the [download page](https://nexilux.com/drivers). That page gives no detail as to what the update does, however the file dates match a news page from January 2024 which states "Pro Gaming Keyboard update adds Xbox Series X|S Compatibility. Added Firmware update for Pro Gaming Keyboard which makes it compatible with XBOX Series X|S. It will require a Windows PC."

The update package includes an executable updater (Windows only) and a binary file. In theory it would be possible for someone with sufficient skills to write and compile new firmware. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any information on the microprocessor used and probably don't have the skills anyway. 

It's a real shame as this is such a well made product that would make a great alternative to the Tartarus. If anyone is interested on taking on the challenge I'd love to hear from you.

The main section is the left side of a standard keyboard. There is no branding on the keys, they are mechanical, very clicky tactile. And as a bonus they are optical keys so will never suffer from switch bounce. On the left are macro keys G1-4 and the ???? key on the right, all of which are membrane. The joystick is analogue but is mapped to produce WSAD when pressed. It also has a push which does ????

The back right of the has connectors for the USB-C output (to the PC/console) 3x USB2.0 and one stereo headphones jack (3.5mm).

The wrist rest is nicely padded and adjustable.
