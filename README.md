Hacking the Vertux Combat Quickstrike gaming keypad.

The Vertux Combat QuickStrike is a one handed gaming keypad with a thumb joystick similar to the classic Razer Tartarus. The body has the the same layout as a standard keyboard with the addition of a joystick under the thumb.

It is a very well built product with one major problem - the joystick is mapped to the WSAD keys, the same keys that are replicated on the keyboard section. There is no way to change any of the key assignments, which makes the product largely pointless. 

There is very little information about this product on the internet, and, as I was given one to try, out I figured I would try to hack it. Spoiler alert: there is no happy ending, reprogramming it will require someone with better hacking skills than me.
